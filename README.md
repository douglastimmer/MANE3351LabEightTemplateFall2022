### Due: November 7, 2022 (before 3:30 pm)

---

## Learning Goals

1.  Utilize a root finding method to solve an engineering problem.

## Problem Description

The speed $v$ of a Saturn V rocket in vertical flight near the surface of earch can be approximated by

$$
v=u\ln\frac{M_0}{M_0-\dot m t}-gt
$$

where


$$
\begin{align}
u&=2510m/s=\mbox{velocity of exhaust relative to the rocket}\\
M_0&=2.8\times 10^6\mbox{kg=mass of rocket at liftoff}\\
\dot m&=13.3\times 10^3\mbox{kg/s=rate of fuel consumption}\\
g&=9.8m/s^2=\mbox{gravitional acceleration}\\
t&=\mbox{time measured from liftoff}
\end{align}
$$

Determine the time when the rocket reaches the speed of sound (335 m/s).


## Your Solution

### Cell 1

Update your personal information found in the first cell that is a Markdown cell.

### Cell 2

In cell 2 (Markdown cell), describe the root finding technique that you will use and the reason you selected your root finding technique. 

### Cell 3

In cell 3 (code cell), enter the Python code to implement your root finding solution. The speed $v$ should be implemented as a user-defined function.
